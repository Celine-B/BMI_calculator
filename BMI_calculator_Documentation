This Shiny app is a simple calculator that provides the Body Mass Index (BMI) and the corresponding weight category for adults 20 years and older. 

On the left panel, the user is invited to use the sliders to enter his height (in meters) and weight (in kilograms). 

Note that the application uses the International system of units (meters and kilograms): 
- 1 inch = 0.0254 meter 
- 1 pound = 0.454 kilograms


The server will use the 2 input values to calculate:
-	The BMI score (“bmi”)
-	The weight category (“bmi_status”)

The BMI function takes two arguments, height and weight, and returns a numerical value based on a simple formula:
BMI = function(height,weight){
        return(weight/(height)^2)
}

The weight category (“bmi_status”) will use the calculated BMI score (“bmi”) to indicate the health status according to the following categories:
BMI Categories:
- Underweight = <18.5
- Normal weight = 18.5–24.9
- Overweight = 25–29.9
- Obesity = BMI of 30 or greater


The ui code (ui.R) defines the user interface which is how the application will look. We will have to enter 2 values: the height in meter and the weight in kilogram. Those 2 inputs values will be used to calculate the BMI score ("bmi") and the associated health status ("bmi_status") that will be displayed on the main panel
The server code (server.R) defines the server logic required to calculate the BMI score ("bmi") and the associated weight category ("bmi_status")
